An enterprise-grade, highly available, and idempotent distributed MLOps orchestration platform. This platform programmatically schedules execution graphs (DAGs), tracks multi-container container life cycles, enforces strict image-layer vulnerability validation boundaries, and exposes an integrated AIOps Control Plane telemetry monitor.

## ⚡ High-Availability Key Features

* **Idempotent Desired-State Enforcement:** Modeled on advanced Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) paradigms to guarantee that container cluster definitions converge cleanly to the target state without data degradation or drift.
* **Deterministic Execution Scheduling (DAG):** Manages processing tasks sequentially across custom-bridged networks to ensure complete network isolation and data separation.
* **Production-Grade SecOps & Lineage:** Integrates automated multi-stage compilation caches, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tree generation, and automated container file vulnerability scanning via Trivy.
* **Integrated Telemetry Control Plane:** Built with an active Streamlit monitoring grid that maps distributed component health, tracks system logs, and exposes interactive hook engines to test fault-tolerant chaos engineering scenarios.

## 🗺️ Platform Architecture & Distributed Topology

The system operates inside an isolated Docker bridge network environment, decoupling high-throughput orchestration processing layers from active UI data visualizers.

### Execution Lifecycles (State Machine Transition Graph)
1. **Data Ingestion Node:** Triggers disk serialization and local cache validation profiles.
2. **Feature Validation Node:** Run statistical drift checking routines ($O(1)$ lookup verification).
3. **Model Training Node:** Pulls deterministic parameter matrices into local runtime environments.
4. **Image Compilation Node:** Compiles hardened output components inside isolated Docker environments.
5. **Registry Promotion Node:** Runs automated vulnerability signature checking and promotes to release boundaries.
